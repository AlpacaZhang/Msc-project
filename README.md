### Hi ðŸ‘‹,I'm alpaca.

- This is my masters project, 
- the code references the ProximityBias-Calibration repository (https://github.com/MiaoXiong2320/ProximityBias-Calibration)
- and has been altered to add a time calculation function. 
- I used the code to select ResNet50 and Beit_large_patch16_384 as comparison models, 
- and the generated results are included in the results document.
